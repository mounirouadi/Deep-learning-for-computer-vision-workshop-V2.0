# Deep-learning-for-computer-vision-workshop-V2.0
Wameedh Scientific Club Deep Learning for Computer Vision workshop repository.
Artificial intelligence is implemented into the smallest parts of our daily lives, its use has become increasingly important and necessary.This workshop is targeted for  beginners in artificial intelligence who are willing to learn its applications in computer vision.You will walk through general AI then dive into deep learning, the algorithms and math behind it. 
At the end you would have  learnt the basics  needed in order to create your own artificial intelligence project.
